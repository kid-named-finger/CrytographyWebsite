                    Cryptography is the idea of concealing information so that only the intended recipients for the message can read it. 
                    The encrypted message must be unreadable and uncrackable for outsiders, otherwise anyone could obtain potentially 
                    sensitive information. <br><br> It's important for messages to be secure because having your home address, phone number or 
                    medical records obtained without permission can put you in danger. 

                    Cryptography is used everywhere without you ever realising it. Before you arrived at this website many processes took place
                    to make sure your access request and the website data was transmitted safety and securly. A varient of encryption (hashing,
                    which we will talk about later) is used to help protect your login information against hackers. Without these safeguards in 
                    place the internet would be a dangerous place to visit.
