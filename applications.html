                    The modern internet is all about data security. Cryptography is a powerful tool <br> used to keep everyone's private data away 
                    from the hands of hackers and criminals. As talked <br> about before, cryptography is vital in the data transmission of 
                    websites, email, and <br> financial information. More specifically we can use cryptographic techniques to <br> authenticate users 
                    and their data. <br><br> The chat application WhatsApp employs a symmetric and asymmetric key to handle data transmissions. 
                    When establishing a connection between your device and the <br> WhatsApp host server, a symmetric key - that is both a public 
                    and private key - is <br> used to ensure a secure connection exists between both parties. We are <br> also making sure that data is
                    concealed from unwanted parties and reaches its <br> destination intact. An asymmetric key is helps to authenticate the user 
                    and will <br> eventually let them access their account.
